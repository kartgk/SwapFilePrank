 Welcome to everyone who is reading this essay. My name is Arjun and this is my essay on the topic of 
the Present Covid Pandemic. This Pandemic has persisted for almost 2 years and is still infecting and killing 
more people. We have to take many measures to control the spread of the virus. We must,
Never touch other people,
Maintain Social Distancing,
Always sneeze into a handkerchief,
Wear a mask,
Sanitize our hand once in a while,
And finally, Hope for the best.
